\section*{Session Summary}
In this session, we examined the coherence between the \(K_1\) space geometry and the formal solution to the flow equation.

\section*{Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Established a baseline for horizontal flow in \(K_1\) space, resulting in \(s = -x\).
    \item Analyzed vertical flows and derived \(s = \log(y)\) for upward and \(s = \log\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\) for downward movements.
    \item Developed a proof detailing the consistent relationship between \(s\) and points in \(K_1\) space.
    \item Produced a LaTeX document encapsulating the proof.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
The flow equation's arithmetic expressions and the geometric properties of \(K_1\) space have been verified to be coherent, solidifying the foundational understanding of arithmetic expression geometry.

\section*{Next Steps}
Further exploration into specific scenarios or new geometric properties within \(K_1\) space is suggested to continue the development of the theory.
