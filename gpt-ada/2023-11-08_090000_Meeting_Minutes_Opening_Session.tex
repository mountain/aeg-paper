\section*{Summary of Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explored the concept of threading arithmetic expressions into geometric shapes to form a new theory.
    \item Mingli provided high-level implications of the theory, aiming to unite geometry, analysis, and computation through 'threadable expressions'.
    \item The long-term objective is to create a new complexity metric considering the temporal-spatial aspects of computation as a geometric flow.
    \item Examined Mingli's draft, noting the introduction and basic concepts are nearly complete.
    \item Discussed Section 3's flow equations and the aspiration to extend classical analytical frameworks.
    \item Conversation led to envisaging new versions of fundamental theorems that incorporate both addition and multiplication.
    \item Mingli plans to focus the current paper on the theoretical foundations by introducing a topological arithmetic expression space in Section 5.
\end{enumerate}
