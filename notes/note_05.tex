\section{Objective and Background}
This note outlines a significant conceptual advance in the arithmetization of the HNN presentation of the $4_1$ knot group, $G_{HNN}(4_1)$, within the framework of Arithmetic Expression Geometry (AEG).
The primary challenge, as detailed in a previous note (cf. `notes/note\_04.tex`), was that a simple arithmetization of the fiber group $F_2 = \langle u, v \rangle$ generators as scalar additions (e.g., $u \equiv \oplus_1$, $v \equiv \oplus_\phi$) leads to commutativity, $uv=vu$, failing to represent $F_2$ faithfully. This note proposes a solution by introducing a novel geometric space for these operations, characterized by a modulo operation with respect to an irrational value, leading to a unique type of singularity.

\section{The $(\alpha, \beta)$ Euclidean Space and Modulo Operation}
We propose that the arithmetic effects of the HNN fiber generators $u$ and $v$ are primarily captured by parameters $(\alpha, \beta)$ accumulating in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space, say $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Let $u$ correspond to an operation that primarily affects $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha \mapsto \alpha + 1$), and $v$ to an operation that primarily affects $\beta$ (e.g., $\beta \mapsto \beta + \phi$, where $\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio, or a related irrational number consistent with the $4_1$ knot's properties).

The crucial insight is to consider the arithmetic values or outcomes modulo a lattice generated by $(1,0)$ and $(0,\phi)$. That is, an arithmetic state characterized by $(\alpha_1, \beta_1)$ is considered equivalent to a state $(\alpha_2, \beta_2)$ if:
\begin{align*}
    \alpha_1 &\equiv \alpha_2 \pmod 1 \\
    \beta_1 &\equiv \beta_2 \pmod \phi
\end{align*}
This means that the effective space of distinguishable arithmetic "values" (in terms of these two additive components) is the quotient space $T^2_{(1,\phi)} = \mathbb{R}^2 / (\mathbb{Z}\cdot(1,0) \oplus \mathbb{Z}\cdot(0,\phi))$.

\section{The Dense Singularity at the Origin}
The point $(0,0)$ in the $(\alpha, \beta)$ space, under this modulo operation, represents an equivalence class $L_0 = \{ (m \cdot 1, n \cdot \phi) \mid m,n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.
Due to the irrationality of $\phi$, if we consider a combined or projected value $k\alpha + l\beta$ (or a more general function $f(\alpha, \beta)$) that contributes to the final arithmetic expression value, the set of points equivalent to the origin becomes dense in $\mathbb{R}$ (or a subset thereof).

This phenomenon leads to a unique type of "singularity" at the origin $(0,0)$ (and its equivalents). This is not a singularity in the analytic sense (like a pole or an essential singularity where a function might diverge). Instead, it is a \textbf{topological singularity} arising from arithmetic incommensurability: the denseness of the equivalence class of the origin under the modulo $(1, \phi)$ operation disrupts the local Euclidean manifold structure if one were to consider the naive quotient space of values directly. Any neighborhood of a point would contain infinitely many points equivalent to the origin's class, violating Hausdorff properties or local diffeomorphic mapping to $\mathbb{R}^n$.

\section{The Resulting Arithmetic Expression Space for $u,v$}
The arithmetic expression space generated by these two specific additive operations, $u \pmod 1$ and $v \pmod \phi$, can thus be conceptualized as a torus $T^2_{(1,\phi)}$ from which this "dense singularity" (the equivalence class of the origin) has been, in some sense, "removed" or "singled out." The operations themselves ($u$ and $v$) act on the universal cover $\mathbb{R}^2$ of this torus.

The non-commutativity required for a faithful representation of $F_2 = \langle u, v \rangle$ is then hypothesized to arise from the geometric action of $u$ and $v$ on this 2-dimensional $(\alpha, \beta)$ space (the universal cover), before the modulo identification. For example, $u$ could be a translation $(\alpha, \beta) \mapsto (\alpha+1, \beta)$, and $v$ could be a more complex operation, perhaps a shear or a transformation whose effect on $\alpha$ depends on $\beta$, or vice-versa, such that $uv \neq vu$ when acting on the pair $(\alpha, \beta)$. The final "value" of an arithmetic expression would then be derived from the resulting $(\alpha, \beta)$ pair, perhaps as $f(\alpha \pmod 1, \beta \pmod \phi)$, or $f(\alpha, \beta)$ where the $m+n\phi$ component is handled separately.

\section{Key Achievements of this Approach}
This conceptual framework yields several significant achievements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{A Novel Geometric Space for Additive Generators}: It defines an arithmetic expression space generated by two additive operations (modulo $1$ and $\phi$) which is topologically akin to a torus with a specific "dense singularity" removed. This space serves as the stage for the arithmetization.
    \item \textbf{A Unique Type of Singularity Identified}: It introduces a singularity rooted in arithmetic incommensurability, which disrupts manifold topology due to denseness rather than analytic misbehavior.
    \item \textbf{Resolution of the $F_2$ Arithmetization for $4_1$ HNN}: By defining the operations $u$ and $v$ on the 2D $(\alpha, \beta)$ space (the universal cover of the "punctured" torus) rather than on a single scalar value subject to their commutative addition, this approach provides a pathway to realize the non-commutative nature of $F_2$. The monodromy relations $t^{-1}ut = h_*(u)$ and $t^{-1}vt = h_*(v)$ can then be imposed as identities on the transformations of $(\alpha, \beta)$, potentially linking the AEG parameter $t$ (associated with the monodromy operation $\mathcal{E}(t)$) to the underlying geometry. The expression space supporting these $F_2$ operations (paths) is then conjectured to be hyperbolic, consistent with the geometry of the $4_1$ knot fiber.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work}
The immediate next steps involve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formalizing the topological description of this "torus with a dense singularity removed."
    \item Defining the explicit actions of $u$ and $v$ as transformations on the $(\alpha, \beta)$ space that are non-commutative and consistent with the HNN structure of $G(4_1)$.
    \item Connecting this $(\alpha, \beta)$ parameter space to the Accumulative Commutative Space (ACS) and the overall metric structure of the expression space (e.g., $\mathfrak{E}_1$ or a specialized $E_{4_1}$).
    \item Detailing how the valuation $\nu(\cdot)$ of arithmetic expressions is performed within this new framework.
\end{itemize}
This approach promises a more robust and geometrically sound arithmetization for knot groups like $G(4_1)$ within AEG.
