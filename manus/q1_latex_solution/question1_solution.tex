\section{Introduction}
This document presents a systematic study of the integer $K$ that appears in the global arithmetic torsion formula, $\mathcal{T}(S) = \Delta(t)(t^K-1)$, specifically for the figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This investigation aims to understand the conditions under which $K$ takes certain values by analyzing various paths (relators) in the knot group $G(4_1)$, using data provided in the `aeg-paper` repository.

The figure-eight knot, denoted as $4_1$, is a prime, alternating knot with a crossing number of four. It is the simplest hyperbolic knot.

\section{Background: Global Arithmetic Torsion}
The concept of global arithmetic torsion is given by the expression $\mathcal{T}(S) = \Delta(t)(t^K-1)$. Here, $\Delta(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of the knot ($t^2 - 3t + 1$ for the $4_1$ knot), $t$ is a parameter, and $K$ is an integer that depends on the chosen path $S$ (a relator) within the knot group $G(4_1)$.

\section{Analysis of $K$ Values from Provided Data}

Data for the knot $4_1$ is available in the `knots/results.tex` file within the `aeg-paper` repository. The relevant section for knot $4_1$ is presented and analyzed below.

\subsection{Data from \texttt{results.tex} for Knot $4_1$}

\noindent The provided data indicates the following for knot $4_1$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Alexander polynomial: $\Delta(a) = a^2 - 3a + 1$.
    \item Cyclotomic polynomials: $\Phi_1(a) = a-1$, $\Phi_2(a) = a+1$.
    \item Path-dependent terms: $p(a) = \nu(S_R)(0,a)$ and $q(a) = \nu(S_{R_{\text{rev}}})(0,a)$.
    \item Torsion: $\tau(a) = p(a) - q(a)$.
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

\subsection{Derivation of $K$}
We use the formula $\mathcal{T}(S) = \Delta(a)(a^K-1)$. The term $\mathcal{T}(S)$ corresponds to the "Torsion $\tau(a)" $ column from Table \ref{tab:knot41_data} (with the variable $t$ replaced by $a$ for consistency with the table notation).
Thus, $a^K-1 = \frac{\tau(a)}{\Delta(a)}$.

\subsubsection{Case 1: Relators \texttt{aaBAbbbAB}, \texttt{abbbaBAAB}}
From Table \ref{tab:knot41_data}, for these relators:
\[ \tau(a) = \frac{-\Delta(a)(a^2-1)}{a^2} \]
Assuming $\Delta(a) \neq 0$, we substitute this into the equation for $a^K-1$:
\[ a^K-1 = \frac{1}{\Delta(a)} \left( \frac{-\Delta(a)(a^2-1)}{a^2} \right) = \frac{-(a^2-1)}{a^2} = \frac{1-a^2}{a^2} \]
Therefore,
\[ a^K = 1 + \frac{1-a^2}{a^2} = \frac{a^2 + 1 - a^2}{a^2} = \frac{1}{a^2} = a^{-2} \]
This implies that for these relators, $K = -2$.

The notes in the table ($k_p=0, k_q=2, \sigma_{\text{eff}}=-1$) provide parameters related to the specific computational framework used to derive $p(a)$ and $q(a)$. The derived $K=-2$ is a direct consequence of the torsion formula and the reported $\tau(a)$.

\subsubsection{Case 2: Relators \texttt{aBAABabbb}, \texttt{bbbABaaBA}, \texttt{bbbaBAABa}}
From Table \ref{tab:knot41_data}, for these relators:
\[ \tau(a) = 0 \]
Assuming $\Delta(a) \neq 0$, we have:
\[ a^K-1 = \frac{0}{\Delta(a)} = 0 \]
This implies $a^K = 1$. If $a$ is not a root of unity, then $K=0$.
This case is of particular interest as it signifies a vanishing component of the arithmetic torsion. The notes confirm $p(a)=q(a)$ for these paths, leading directly to $\tau(a)=0$.

\section{Discussion of Path Properties and $K$ Values}

The analysis reveals two distinct $K$ values for the provided sets of relators for the $4_1$ knot:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K = -2$ for relators like \texttt{aaBAbbbAB}.
    \item $K = 0$ for relators like \texttt{aBAABabbb}.
\end{itemize}

Further investigation would involve:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item **Algebraic Structure of Relators:** Analyzing the word structure of these relators in the generators of $G(4_1)$ (e.g., Wirtinger presentation or other common presentations like $\langle x,y \mid xyx^{-1}yxy^{-1}x^{-1}y^{-1} \rangle = 1$) to identify features correlating with $K=-2$ versus $K=0$. This could involve looking at exponent sums, subword patterns, or relationships to specific group operations.
    \item **Geometric Interpretation in (U,V) Space:** Visualizing these paths in the $(U,V)$ reference space, as conceptualized in related research questions. The geometric properties (net displacement, enclosed area, winding numbers) of paths leading to $K=-2$ versus $K=0$ could reveal underlying geometric reasons for the different $K$ values.

    \end{figure}
    \item **Role of $k_p, k_q, \sigma_{\text{eff}}$:** Understanding the precise relationship between the parameters $k_p, k_q, \sigma_{\text{eff}}$ (from the notes in Table \ref{tab:knot41_data}) and the derived integer $K$. These parameters likely encode information about how $p(a)$ and $q(a)$ are constructed from $\Delta(a)$ and cyclotomic factors, which in turn determines $K$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
By directly analyzing the provided data for the $4_1$ knot, we have determined specific integer $K$ values associated with different relators. For the relator set including \texttt{aaBAbbbAB}, $K=-2$. For the set including \texttt{aBAABabbb}, $K=0$ (assuming $a$ is not a root of unity). This detailed analysis, incorporating the explicit data from `results.tex`, provides a concrete foundation for understanding the behavior of $K$ in the arithmetic torsion formula for the $4_1$ knot. Future work should focus on correlating these $K$ values with the algebraic and geometric properties of the paths.
