## Review of Figures and Calculations for Revised Solutions

This document outlines the findings and decisions based on the user's latest feedback regarding figures and calculations in the three LaTeX solutions.

### 1. Figure Selection and Usage

The user indicated that specific, contextually appropriate figures are already available in the `aeg-paper` repository, particularly referenced or contained within `knots/knots_01.tex`.

**Analysis of `knots/knots_01.tex` and repository structure:**

*   **General Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$) Diagram:**
    *   `knots/knots_01.tex` itself uses `\usepackage{pst-knot}` to draw the $4_1$ knot directly: `\psKnot[linewidth=3pt,linecolor=blue](0,0){4-1}`.
    *   The previously used TikZ figure (`knot_4_1.tex`, originally from `aeg-invitation/misc/knot_4_1.tex` and placed in `manus/qX_latex_solution/figures/`) is also a valid representation.
    *   **Decision**: For consistency and ease of use across the three `manus` solution documents, we will continue to use the TikZ version (`knot_4_1.tex`) placed in each solution's `figures` subdirectory (`manus/qX_latex_solution/figures/knot_4_1.tex`). This avoids introducing `pst-knot` dependencies if not already handled and keeps figures local to each solution's directory structure as previously set up.

*   **Figure for Question 1 (K-Values and (U,V) Space Concept):**
    *   The conceptual (U,V) path diagram (`uv_path_example.tex`, originally from `aeg-paper/misc/01-grid-example-1.tex` and placed in `manus/q1_latex_solution/figures/`) remains suitable for illustrating the general idea of paths in (U,V) space.
    *   **Decision**: Retain `uv_path_example.tex` for Question 1.

*   **Figure for Question 2 ((U,V) Path Visualization and Weighted Area):**
    *   `knots/knots_01.tex` includes `\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/knot_4_1}` and captions it as "Schematic representation of the relator path in the arithmetic expression space H". This refers to the file `/home/ubuntu/aeg-paper/images/knot_4_1.pdf` (or a similar image format).
    *   **Decision**: This schematic (`../../images/knot_4_1.pdf` relative to the Q2 solution document) should be the **primary conceptual figure** for Question 2, illustrating the (U,V) path concept as intended by the user.
    *   The previously generated `uv_path_q2_specific.tex` (which calculates and draws a path for $S = \text{aBAABabb}$ with $t=e$ or $t=2$) can be retained as a **secondary, worked example** to demonstrate concrete path construction and area calculation, but it must be clearly distinguished from the user's primary schematic.

*   **Figure for Question 3 (Parameter Calibration):**
    *   The `pgfplots` graph of the Alexander polynomial $\Delta_{4_1}(t)$ generated for Question 3 is specific to the content of this question and does not seem to have a pre-existing counterpart indicated by the user.
    *   **Decision**: Retain the generated `pgfplots` graph for Question 3.

### 2. Question 2: $V$ Accumulation and Integral Base

The user pointed out that the integral calculation in Question 2 might be using an incorrect base for the logarithm in the $V$ coordinate accumulation (e.g., using $t=e$ by default) and that the context might imply an accumulation related to $\ln 2$.

**Review and Decision:**

*   The formula for $V$ is $V = \sum \ln t_k$. The integral factor is $e^V$. This structure is general.
*   The example calculation in the previous revision of Question 2 used $t=e$, which makes $\ln t = 1$. This simplifies coordinates but might not be the most relevant example if the user's work often uses $t=2$ or if $\ln 2$ accumulation is a key concept.
*   **Decision for Q2 Revision**: The example calculation for the path $S = \text{aBAABabb}$ (or another suitable short, closed path) will be revised to use $t=2$. This means:
    *   Operation `a` (multiplication by $t=2$) corresponds to a change $(0, \ln 2)$ in $(U,V)$.
    *   Operation `A` (multiplication by $t^{-1}=1/2$) corresponds to a change $(0, -\ln 2)$ in $(U,V)$.
    *   The $V$ coordinates in the path will be multiples of $\ln 2$.
    *   The integral $\oint_S -e^V dU$ will be recalculated with these new $V$ values. For example, if $V = k 
 \ln 2$, then $e^V = e^{k 
 \ln 2} = (e^{\ln 2})^k = 2^k$.
    *   The TikZ figure `uv_path_q2_specific.tex` will be updated to reflect these new coordinates and axis scaling if necessary (though the topological shape of the path for the given relator word will be similar, the $V$-axis values will change).

This review will guide the subsequent steps of updating the figures and calculations in the LaTeX solution documents.
