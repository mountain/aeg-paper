\section*{Introduction}
This document provides a proof of the coherence between the geometry of the \( K_1 \) space as defined in arithmetic expression geometry and the direct formal solution to the flow equation \( \frac{da}{ds} = \cos(\theta) + a \sin(\theta) \).
\section*{Proof}
\subsection*{Part 1: Horizontal Flow in \( K_1 \) Space}
We demonstrate the horizontal flow along the \( x \)-axis in \( K_1 \) space and the coherence with the assignment function \( A \).
\subsection*{Part 2: Vertical Flow in \( K_1 \) Space}
We extend the exploration to vertical flows within \( K_1 \) space, confirming consistency with the geometry and arithmetic expressions.
\section*{Conclusion}
The consolidation of horizontal and vertical movements confirms the correctness of the \( K_1 \) space geometry with respect to the flow equation, thus demonstrating the complete coherence within the arithmetic expression geometry framework.
