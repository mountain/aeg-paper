In this section, we construct an special domain in the Euclidean plane, and then define a new model for hyperbolic plane based on this domain.
We show that this model is isometric to the Poincar\'e disk model. Finally, we provide two ways to construct the order-4 apeirogonal tiling of the hyperbolic plane.
We also defined three scalar fields $X, Y, L$ on the hyperbolic plane which will be used in the next section.

We define a domain $D$ in the Euclidean plane as follows. Let $D$ be the union of the following regions:
