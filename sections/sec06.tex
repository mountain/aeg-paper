\subsection{Core Definitions and the Contact Structure}\label{subsec:core_definitions}

We begin by establishing our geometric space. Consider a 3-dimensional manifold with coordinates $(u,v) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and a value field $a \in \mathbb{R}$. The geometry is built upon two fundamental 1-forms, defined using constant real parameters $\mu$ and $\lambda$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:contact_forms_def}
\omega := \mu\,du + \lambda a\,dv, \qquad \alpha := da - \omega.
\end{equation}
The 1-form $\alpha$ is central to our construction. Its primary role is to define a ``horizontal'' plane at each point, known as the contact distribution. To see how it works, let's consider its action on an arbitrary vector field $X = x_u \partial_u + x_v \partial_v + x_a \partial_a$. Recalling that $da(X) = x_a$, $du(X) = x_u$, and $dv(X) = x_v$, the action is given by:
\[
\alpha(X) = da(X) - \mu\,du(X) - \lambda a\,dv(X) = x_a - \mu x_u - \lambda a x_v.
\]
The set of all vectors $X$ for which $\alpha(X)=0$ constitutes this horizontal plane.

Throughout this work, we use two types of differentials in parallel: (i) the standard de Rham exterior derivative $d$, which is always nilpotent ($d^2=0$); and (ii) the \textbf{expression differential} $\delta$, which is axiomatically defined in Section~\ref{ch:differential_calculus}.

\paragraph{The Contact Property.}
A key property of $\alpha$ is that it defines a contact structure on our 3D space. This is verified by checking if the 3-form $\alpha \wedge d\alpha$ is a volume form (i.e., non-zero everywhere). First, we compute the exterior derivative of $\omega$:
\[
d\omega = d(\mu\,du + \lambda a\,dv) = \lambda\,da \wedge dv.
\]
Then, the exterior derivative of $\alpha$ is simply $d\alpha = d(da - \omega) = -d\omega = -\lambda\,da \wedge dv$. Now, we can compute the wedge product:
\begin{align*}
\alpha \wedge d\alpha &= (da - \omega) \wedge (-\lambda\,da \wedge dv) \\
&= -da \wedge (\lambda\,da \wedge dv) + \omega \wedge (\lambda\,da \wedge dv) \\
&= 0 + (\mu\,du + \lambda a\,dv) \wedge (\lambda\,da \wedge dv) \\
&= \mu\lambda\,du \wedge da \wedge dv + \lambda^2 a\,\underbrace{dv \wedge da \wedge dv}_{=0} \\
&= \mu\lambda\,du \wedge da \wedge dv.
\end{align*}
Provided $\mu\lambda \neq 0$, this is a volume form, confirming that $\alpha$ is a \textbf{contact form}.

\paragraph{Normal Form, Reeb Field, and Contact Distribution.}
By introducing natural units $\tilde{u} = \mu u$ and $\tilde{v} = \lambda v$, the form $\alpha$ is reduced to its canonical form $\alpha_0 = da - d\tilde{u} - a\,d\tilde{v}$, which facilitates comparison with standard literature.

The Reeb vector field $R$, defined by $i_R d\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha(R) = 1$, is $R = -(1/\mu)\partial_u$. The contact distribution $\mathcal{H}$, as introduced earlier, is formally the kernel of $\alpha$:
\[
\mathcal{H} := \ker\alpha = \{X \in TM : \alpha(X) = 0\}.
\]
Viewing the tangent bundle as a composition of the $(u,v)$-base and the $a$-fiber, the form $\alpha = da - \omega$ intrinsically links the ``vertical'' change $da$ to the ``horizontal'' displacement defined by $\omega$.

\subsection{The Geometry on the Contact Distribution \texorpdfstring{$\ker\alpha$}{ker(alpha)}} % Revised title for 6.2
\label{subsec:geometry_on_ker_alpha}

We now define two special vector fields that form a basis for the horizontal plane $\mathcal{H}$ at every point. These are the horizontal lifts of the base coordinate vectors, which we term the \textbf{expression directional derivatives}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:directional_derivatives}
D_u := \partial_u + \mu\,\partial_a, \qquad D_v := \partial_v + \lambda a\,\partial_a.
\end{equation}
These fields are constructed specifically to be horizontal, a fact we can verify directly. For $D_u$, its coordinate components are $(x_u, x_v, x_a) = (1, 0, \mu)$. Applying the formula for $\alpha(X)$:
\[
\alpha(D_u) = x_a - \mu x_u - \lambda a x_v = \mu - \mu(1) - \lambda a(0) = 0.
\]
For $D_v$, its components are $(x_u, x_v, x_a) = (0, 1, \lambda a)$. Applying $\alpha$:
\[
\alpha(D_v) = x_a - \mu x_u - \lambda a x_v = \lambda a - \mu(0) - \lambda a(1) = 0.
\]
Since both $D_u$ and $D_v$ are annihilated by $\alpha$, and they are clearly linearly independent, they form a basis for the 2-dimensional contact distribution:
\[
\ker\alpha = \text{span}\{D_u, D_v\}.
\]

For any smooth scalar field $F(u,v,a)$, we define its expression differential $\delta F$ and the directional derivative $D_\theta$ as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}\tag{3}
\delta F := (D_uF)\,du + (D_vF)\,dv, \qquad D_\theta := \cos\theta\,D_u + \sin\theta\,D_v.
\end{equation}
This construction effectively reduces the geometry from the three-dimensional space $(u,v,a)$ to the two-dimensional contact distribution $\mathcal{H}$.

\paragraph{Structural Relation between d and $\delta$.}
For any scalar field $F$, the two differentials are related by a fundamental identity:
\[
\boxed{ \delta F = dF - (\partial_a F)\,\alpha }
\]
This identity can be interpreted as projecting $dF$ onto the horizontal distribution $\mathcal{H}$ by subtracting its vertical component along $\alpha$. Expanding this definition yields:
\[
\delta F = (F_u + \mu F_a)\,du + (F_v + \lambda a F_a)\,dv,
\]
which is consistent with Eq.~\eqref{eq:15}. In particular, we recover $\delta a = \omega$, $\delta u = du$, and $\delta v = dv$.

\subsection{Legendrian Flow and Rectification}

A curve $\gamma(s) = (u(s), v(s), a(s))$ is \textbf{Legendrian} if its tangent vector lies in the contact distribution, i.e., $\dot\gamma(s) \in \ker\alpha$. For such a curve, the evolution of $a$ is governed by the \textbf{flow equation}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}\tag{4}
\frac{da}{ds} = D_\theta a = \mu\cos\theta + \lambda a\sin\theta,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ parameterizes the angle of the tangent vector in the basis $\{D_u,D_v\}$. With respect to a given metric on the base manifold, this flow equation can be written in its Eikonal form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}\tag{5}
\|\nabla a\| = \sqrt{\mu^2 + \lambda^2 a^2}.
\end{equation}
We introduce a \textbf{rectifying variable} $y$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}\tag{6}
y = \arcsin\left(\frac{\lambda a}{\mu}\right) \quad\Rightarrow\quad \|\nabla y\| = \lambda.
\end{equation}
This rectification transforms the non-linear velocity field for $a$ into a constant-speed flow for $y$, which is advantageous for geometric constructions and enhances numerical stability.

\paragraph{Non-commutativity and Curvature.}
The commutator of the horizontal vector fields yields a purely vertical vector, reflecting the "curvature" of the contact distribution. This phenomenon can be described as a "vertical return":
\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}\tag{7}
[D_u,D_v] = \mu\lambda\,\partial_a,\qquad \delta^2F = \mu\lambda(\partial_a F)\,du\wedge dv,\qquad \delta^2 a = \mu\lambda\,du\wedge dv.
\end{equation}
The circulation-area formula provides a tool for quantifying mesh singularities and global topological constraints:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:8}\tag{8}
\oint_{\partial\Sigma}\omega = \iint_\Sigma d\omega = \mu\lambda\iint_\Sigma du\wedge dv.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Compatibility with de Rham Cohomology.}
The exterior derivative of $\omega$ is $d\omega = \lambda\,da\wedge dv$. By pulling this 2-form back to a section where $\alpha=0$ (i.e., substituting $da=\omega$), we obtain:
\[
(d\omega)^* = \lambda\,\omega\wedge dv = \mu\lambda\,du\wedge dv,
\]
which is identical to $\delta^2 a$. This demonstrates the precise collaborative relationship between $d$ and $\delta$.

\paragraph{Example: Basis Flows.}
Flowing along $D_u$ implies $\dot{a} = \mu \Rightarrow a(s) = a_0 + \mu s$. Flowing along $D_v$ implies $\dot{a} = \lambda a \Rightarrow a(s) = a_0 e^{\lambda s}$. Linear combinations of these generate the general flow given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:4}.

\paragraph{Remark (Generalization to Surfaces).}
On an arbitrary oriented Riemannian surface with an orthonormal coframe $\{\theta^1, \theta^2\}$ and connection 1-form $\varpi$, we define
\begin{gather}
\omega=\mu\,\theta^1+\lambda a\,\theta^2, \quad \alpha=da-\omega, \label{eq:18} \tag{18-19} \\
d\omega=\mu\lambda\,\theta^1\wedge\theta^2+\varpi\wedge(\lambda a\,\theta^1-\mu\,\theta^2). \nonumber
\end{gather}
The flow equation and rectification hold analogously, with $d\omega$ now including a geometric torsion term involving $\varpi$.
