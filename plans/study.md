# Literature Search Notes for AEG Project (2025-05-21)

**Context:** Reviewing literature relevant to Arithmetic Expression Geometry (AEG), focusing on connections to knot theory (esp. 4_1 knot), group representations, arithmetization, complexity, RG flow, and HNN extensions, informed by recent work in `knots/` and `notes/` folders.

## 1. Arithmetic Topology & Knot Group Representations

*   **Core Concept:** Arithmetic Topology studies analogies between knot theory (3-manifolds) and number theory (primes).
    *   **Relevance:** Provides a foundational theory for the "arithmetization" of knots and potentially AEG.
*   **Key Resource:**
    *   Morishita, M. - "Knots and Primes: An Introduction to Arithmetic Topology". (Consider acquiring)
*   **Knot Group Representations:**
    *   Representations of the knot group (fundamental group of knot complement) into matrix groups like `SL(2,C)` are central.
    *   These representations link knot geometry (hyperbolic structures) to algebraic/arithmetic properties.
    *   Deformation theory of these representations is an active research area.
    *   **Relevance:** Directly supports work on representations of knot groups. `SL(2,C)` representations of the 4_1 knot are particularly relevant.
*   **Actionable:**
    *   Explore `SL(2,C)` representations for the 4_1 knot in detail.
    *   Investigate how concepts from Arithmetic Topology can structure the AEG framework.

## 2. Geometric & Algebraic Complexity of Knots

*   **Geometric Complexity:**
    *   For hyperbolic knots (like 4_1), **hyperbolic volume** of the knot complement is a key invariant.
    *   Alternatively, complexity can be measured by the number of ideal tetrahedra in a triangulation.
    *   **Relevance:** Offers potential metrics for the complexity of geometric objects within AEG.
*   **Algebraic Complexity:**
    *   Relates to the structure and properties of the knot group. Examples: Word problem difficulty, algorithmic decidability of properties (e.g., determining if the group is Z).
    *   **Relevance:** Could inform understanding of the complexity of corresponding arithmetic structures in AEG.
*   **Connection:** Strong interplay between geometric and algebraic complexity. Geometrization Theorem is relevant.
*   **Actionable:**
    *   Consider hyperbolic volume as a complexity measure within AEG.
    *   Relate knot group complexity to the structure of arithmetic expressions.

## 3. Renormalization Group (RG) Flow

*   **RG Flow as Geometric Flow:**
    *   RG flow is viewed as a flow in a parameter space (of theories, couplings), analogous to geometric flows (e.g., Ricci flow).
    *   **Relevance:** Supports the "flow equation" concept within the AEG paper.
*   **Connection to Information Geometry:**
    *   Information Geometry provides geometric structures on spaces of probability distributions/statistical models.
    *   **Relevance:** Could offer mathematical tools for geometrizing computation or information within AEG.
*   **Analogies & Computation:**
    *   Parallels with established geometric flows might provide technical/conceptual inspiration.
    *   Computing RG flows is often complex.
*   **Actionable:**
    *   Explore Information Geometry for tools and concepts applicable to AEG.
    *   Draw explicit analogies between the AEG flow equation and RG flow.

## 4. HNN Extensions in Geometry & Topology

*   **Group Construction:**
    *   HNN extensions are fundamental in combinatorial group theory for constructing groups.
    *   Topologically, they arise as fundamental groups of spaces formed by gluing parts together (via Seifert-van Kampen theorem).
*   **Geometric Group Theory:**
    *   Used to build groups acting on geometric spaces (e.g., CAT(0) spaces).
    *   Important for understanding group structure and embeddings.
*   **Modeling Iteration:**
    *   The structure `t*a*t^-1 = phi(a)` inherently models iterative processes.
    *   **Relevance:** Directly applicable to "HNN arithmetization" mentioned in `notes/`. Useful for modeling iterative examples within AEG.
*   **Actionable:**
    *   Develop the "HNN arithmetization" concept within the AEG framework.
    *   Use HNN extensions to formalize iterative constructions in AEG.
    *   Explore connections to fundamental groups of spaces representing combined arithmetic expressions.
